This repository provides a solution for managing department hierarchies in an ASP.NET MVC application. It utilizes Entity Framework Core for data access, AutoMapper for mapping between data entities and view models, and potentially Hangfire for background job processing (optional).

Features:

Display department hierarchies in a user-friendly tree structure.
Retrieve details of a specific department, including its sub-departments and parent departments (optional).
(Optional) Schedule email notifications or other background tasks using Hangfire (not included in this basic solution).
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/adamlee2020/Clean.Architecture.git
Use code with caution.

Prerequisites:

.NET Core SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
A database provider compatible with your chosen database (e.g., Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer for SQL Server)
(Optional) Hangfire server and dependencies (if implementing background tasks)
Configuration:

Update the appsettings.json file with your database connection string and other configuration settings.
(Optional) Configure Hangfire connection and job definitions (if applicable).
Run the Application:

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
Set RingoMedia.Web as the startup project.
Run the application (usually F5 in Visual Studio).
Code Structure:

Clean.Architecture.DataAccess: Contains data access layer classes using Entity Framework Core for interacting with the database and the Entitied (Models) for the project.
Clean.Architecture.Infrastructure: Defines the repositories and interfaces for the project.
ViewModels: Defines view models used for transferring data between the controller and views.
Services: Contains application services for department-related operations.
UI: The ASP.NET MVC application core, including controllers and views.

Additional Notes:

This is a basic example and can be extended to include features like department creation, editing, or deletion (not included here).
Error handling and logging are recommended for a production-ready application.
Security considerations like user authentication and authorization should be implemented for real-world scenarios.
